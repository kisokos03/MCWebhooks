# MCWebhooks

Currently a WIP, base functionality is present. 

It can send and edit its own webhooks, however live server testing is still non-functional, requiring an easier setup system. 


## Todo

* automatically download necessary script files ✓ + force reinstall
* fix javascript error detection logic during setup ✓
* add more customization options such as custom colours, messages or whole embeds (?)
* ### *more server command options + functionality:*
  * command to force check players ✓
  * automatically refresh player count/time
  * manage customization from server commands
