# MCWebhooks
 PaperMC plugin for clean functional webhooks to show server stats and info.

Currently a WIP, only base functionality is present. 

It can send and edit its own webhooks, however live server testing is still non-functional, requiring an easier setup system. 


**TODO**:
    
* automatically download necessary script files
* fix javascript error detection logic during setup
* add more customization options such as custom colours, messages or whole embeds (?)
